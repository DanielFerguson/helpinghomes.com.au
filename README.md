## Questions

- How can we outline places of danger, evacuations, etc?
- How can we allow businesses to add support offers as well? Another page of business offers, with a map of locations so users can get relevant offers? It would be cool if we could scrape branding details (logo/favicon/color) from a businesses website.
- How can we allow users to report offers, and how do we mediate those?
